# DEPRECATED (@cognite/auth-wrapper)

[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

This package is deprecated due to low usage. We recommend to use SDKs for your auth provider instead, like the [msal package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/msal-browser) for Microsoft Azure AD.

---

The `@cognite/auth-wrapper` is an OpenID Connect/OAuth 2.0 Wrapper library written in js that provides a convenient way to retrieve access token from any IdP that meets the openid pattern. You can use on client-side or server-side with JavaScript applications.

## Getting Started
There are some guides to help you to start using any of our available authentication methods.
The guides are at [authentication.md](./guides/authentication.md).

## Samples

There are small bare-bones typescript projects in the `samples/` directory.
They show how to include to retrieve a token with cognite Auth Wrapper by different methods.
The samples' [README.md](./samples/README.md) has instructions for running the samples.

E.g: Client Credentials
```ts
import { CogniteAuthWrapper } from '@cognite/auth-wrapper';

const token = await CogniteAuthWrapper.load(
    'client_credentials',
    {
        authority: 'your_authority',
        client_id: 'your_client_id',
        grant_type: 'your_grant_type',
        client_secret: 'your_client_secret',
        scope: 'your_scope'
    }
).login();
```
